# E-commerce Sales Insights and Customer Segmentation using RFM 

## Description:
This end-to-end data analysis endeavor leverages a rich sales dataset of an Online Retail store and employs a synergy of SQL and Tableau to uncover actionable insights, from sales performance trends to customer segmentation (using RFM Analysis). The goal of the project is to be able to analyse sales dynamics of the store and also understand customer behavior to provide business insights.

**Domain: E-Commerce or Retail Analytics**

**Data Dictionary:**
The dataset contains information related to customer sales transactions. It includes details about the customers, the items purchased, invoice information, and monetary values. The dataset is intended for performing RFM analysis and customer segmentation. Here are the key columns present in the dataset:

- Country: The country where the sales transaction occurred.
- Customer ID: A unique identifier for each customer.
- Item Description: A description of the purchased item.
- Item Code: A code associated with the purchased item.
- Invoice ID: A unique identifier for each invoice.
- Invoice Date: The date when the invoice was generated.
- Unit Price: The price of a single unit of the purchased item.
- Quantity: The quantity of items purchased in the transaction.
- Sales Amount: The total monetary value of the transaction.

## Project Task:
- Phase 1: Unveiling Sales Dynamics and Customer Behavior with SQL
  
In this, we can understand sales performance with in-depth sales analysis using SQL. This is done through dissecting the dataset, calculating critical metrics that uncover sales patterns. Through SQL queries, we understand the monthly sales trends, spotlight top-selling products, assess revenue concentration, and unveil month-over-month growth rates. This granular analysis sets the stage for strategic decision-making. Moving forward we analyse customer behavior such as customer purchase frequency, top spending customers, customer churn Rate, etc to understand how they shop, and help tailor offerings to their needs.
